# Myorange
The aim of Myorange is to help people build their cloud storage systems within several lines of code and configuration. 
People may deploy our product on their server or a cloud service provider. 
They may choose the target disk they want their files to go into, e.g. Local disk, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Platform. 
We would provide a full permission system that enables you, as a root, to know every detail of the file system and usersâ€™ usage status. 
In addition, Myorange Drive also supports public file sharing. Files can be shared to others through a single url, with a potential limitation of times.
